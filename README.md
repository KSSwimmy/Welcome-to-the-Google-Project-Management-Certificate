## Explore project management roles

### Project management job categories and common roles 

#### Introductory-level project management roles

Entry-level project management positions are a great opportunity to get your foot in the door and learn the ins and outs of how a company operates and manages projects. The lessons you learn from these experiences are extremely valuable to your growth in project management. Some entry-level project management positions include:

- **Junior Project Manager:** Performs all aspects of being a project manager alongside a more experienced professional.

- **Project Administrator:** Assists the rest of the project team with administrative tasks. 

- **Project/Program Assistant:** Supports team members working on a project and offers administrative support. May perform research or create training documents along with other jobs as assigned by program leaders.

- **Project/Program Coordinator:** Participates in hands-on project work and administrative tasks. Works under a project manager to make sure projects are completed on time and within budget.

- **Project Support Specialist:** Works alongside a project manager and team members to oversee assigned projects. May also be responsible for training and developing employees to perform designated tasks.

#### Traditional project management roles

Once you have gained some experience in introductory-level positions, you can explore traditional project management roles, such as:

- **Project Manager:** Responsible for the initiating, planning, executing, monitoring, and closing of a project. Includes industry-specific titles like IT project manager, construction project manager, or engineering project manager, which utilize skills that are transferable among industries.

- **Project Analyst:** Moves a project along by sharing information, providing support through data analysis, and contributing to strategy and performance. 

- **Project Leader/Director:** Drives core decision-making and sets the direction for the project. Usually knowledgeable about the product or deliverable. 

- **Project Controller:** Primarily responsible for project planning. You are likely to see this job title in industries like engineering and construction.

- **Technical Project Manager:** Conducts project planning and management for identified goals within a company. Ensures that projects are completed to the requirements within a defined time frame and budget.

- **Project Management Office (PMO) Analyst:** Manages the progress of complex projects to ensure timely execution and completion. 

#### Program and portfolio management roles

As you have learned, project managers are responsible for the day-to-day management of projects. They shepherd projects from start to finish and serve as a guide for their team. Project managers must apply the right tools, techniques, and processes to complete the project successfully, on time, and within budget. 

After you have carried out projects successfully and feel you are ready for a step up in responsibility, a program manager position may be the next step for you. While a project is one single-focused endeavor, a program is a collection of projects. Program managers are responsible for managing many projects. At Google, all project managers are called program managers because they manage multiple projects simultaneously. 

Successfully implementing programs as a program manager can eventually make you a great fit for more senior positions, such as a senior program manager or a portfolio manager. A portfolio is a collection of projects and programs across an entire organization. Portfolio managers are responsible for portfolios of projects or programs for one client. Over the course of your career, you might progress from project manager to program manager to portfolio manager roles.

While project, program, and portfolio managers hold different types and levels of responsibility, they are all project managers. In Course 4 of this certificate program, you will learn more about differentiating projects, programs, and portfolios.

- **Program managers:** Manage a group of projects that are related or similar to one another and handle the coordination of these projects. They facilitate effective communication between individual project managers and provide support where necessary. They also help create and manage long-term goals for their organization.

- **Portfolio managers:** Responsible for managing a group of related programs within the same organization. They coordinate various programs in order to ensure they are on track and that the organization is meeting its strategic initiatives. Portfolio managers look at all projects and programs within the organization and prioritize work as necessary. 

#### Operational management roles 
In operational management roles, you will get the opportunity to experience several different departments and how they interact and operate. Operational management roles allow you to work alongside peers and management from various business segments, giving you an appreciation for what each segment does on a daily basis. Key elements of project management include making sure a project is on budget and on schedule. This course, and your experience as a project manager, will give you the tools to be able to apply those skills to running a business. Some operational management positions include:

- **Operations Analyst:** Manages and coordinates research, investigates workflows, creates business procedures, and recommends changes to improve the project and company. 

- **Operations Manager:** Oversees strategic decision-making and rolls out plans of action based on financial, schedule, and resource reporting. 

- **Chief Operating Officer:** Responsible for overseeing the day-to-day administrative and operational functions of a business.

#### Agile roles

We will discuss the Agile project management approach in depth later, but here are a couple of the positions you may see that are related to that approach:

- **Scrum Master:** Coordinates and guides the Scrum team. Knowledgeable in Agile framework and Scrum and is able to teach others about the Scrum values and principles. May also be listed as a Technical Program Manager or Technical Project Manager. 

- **Product Owner:** Drives the direction of product development and progress. 

**Industry-specific management roles**

As you search for project management roles, you may see positions with titles like “engineering project manager” or “construction project manager.” Keep in mind that the skills you learn in one industry can be applied to another industry. For example, you may have experience as a software engineer but are interested in pursuing a career in project management. You will be able to apply what you’ve learned working in a technical field, as well as with the skills you have picked up in this certification course, to a project manager position in multiple industries. Having experience working on a team to achieve a task and understanding how to execute an effort on schedule and on budget are aspects of your professional experience—combined with your project management knowledge—that make it possible for you to move between industries.

---

Maybe you'll even start to notice that the job's responsibilities seem like tasks you've covered in this course, 
- like creating monthly status reports, 
- helping to implement new and necessary technologies, 
- tracking work plans and performance metrics, 
- assisting other members of the operations team on given projects,
- ensuring timely responses to requests for information.

# Introduction: Becoming an effective project manager

### Exploring how a project manager adds value

Project managers add value to their teams and organizations through **effective prioritization** of tasks required to complete a project.

**Stakeholders** are people who are interested in and affected by the project's completion and success, like the leader of an organization. 

Project managers use **delegation** to add value to their teams and organizations by matching tasks to individuals who can best complete the work.

Project managers deliver value through **effective communication**, both with their team and with key stakeholders.

***How do project managers use prioritization to add value to their team?***
They determine which tasks are the most critical to the success of the project.

### Learning more about project manager roles and responsibilities

Project managers usually follow a process that involves 
- planning and organizing, 
- managing tasks, 
- budgeting, and controlling costs, and other factors,

so that the project can be completed within the approved budget and timeframe. 

A **project task** is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time by you, your team, or your stakeholders.

One responsibility that falls under the umbrella of planning and organizing is making use of productivity tools and creating processes.

create plans, timelines, schedules, and other forms of documentation to track project completion, and you'll usually need to maintain those documents throughout the entirety of the project.

- Budgeting and controlling costs and other factors 
- Monitor and manage the budget
- Track issues and risks 
- Manage quality
- Remove unforeseen barriers

## Responsibilities that utilize interpersonal skills

***What are the core job responsibilities of project managers? Let’s recap what we learned in the previous video.***

The project manager is responsible for planning, organizing, managing tasks, budgeting, controlling costs, and other factors to help keep the project within budget and on time. 

What does that mean? Basically, as the project manager, you will be responsible for tracking the day-to-day details of the project, but you will also have an opportunity to step back and see the bigger picture of the overall project.

Depending on the project and organization, you may also have responsibilities that utilize your interpersonal skills. **Interpersonal skills** are the behaviors you use to interact with others, such as communication, active listening, and leadership.

**Teaching and mentoring**
As a project manager, you can serve as a mentor to your team. When you take the time to fully explain the expectations, you eliminate rework, confusion, and frustration. Mentoring and teaching others the lessons that you, as a project manager, have learned allows your team to make better choices and build on your experience. Mentoring also involves supporting each individual on your team in meeting expectations and helping them to exceed their own sense of personal potential.

**Building relationships** 
Relationships are everything! Getting to know your team members lets them know that you care about them as people, not just as employees. Taking the time to build relationships with your customers, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders is equally important. Dedicate time to check in with people. Pay attention to the insights they offer you about their work style since their actions can inform how to most effectively interact with them. Ask about their lives beyond the project, and then follow up on those discussions later on to show your interest. When you foster these relationships, you are all more invested in the success of your project.

**Controlling change**
The American novelist Louis L’Amour wrote, “The only thing that never changes is that everything changes.” This applies to projects as well. Projects change as you continue to understand the expectations and the needs of your stakeholders. As a project manager, you need to remain flexible and adjust to the stakeholders’ needs. However, it is also important to protect your team from constant change and rework. A good way to do this is by documenting the initial expectations of the project and clearly identifying the changes being requested. It is also helpful to understand the budget and schedule impact of the changes and make sure that the stakeholders understand those impacts. As the project manager, you are responsible for protecting your team. 

**Empowering your team**
We all enjoy being heard and appreciated in our careers. Giving your team the ability to work directly with the stakeholders and their teams lets them know that you trust and believe in their skills! One of the best things about empowering your team is getting fresh ideas and passionate employees willing to help find solutions to problems. Another way you can empower your team is by delegating responsibilities to them, allowing them to make some decisions for the project, and using their input in the planning and execution of the project. Effective mentoring often leads to more empowered teams.

**Communicating status and concerns**
As a project manager, communication is everything. With effective communication, you can work together with your team to find solutions to challenges. The project manager sets the tone for the project. Maintaining an open door policy and building trust within your team and among stakeholders—all while staying positive—will help the success of the project.

### Acquiring the core skills of a successful project manager

#### The core skills of a project manager

Skills for successful project management 

- **Enabling decision making** -  The ability to enable decision-making on the team, or gathering decisions from the appropriate leader, is crucial to keep projects on task and achieve their goals.
- **communication and escalating** - As a project manager, you'll use your communication skills in just about everything you do. This might look like documenting plans, sending emails about the status of the project, or holding a meeting to escalate risks or issues to stakeholders.
- **Flexibility** - As a project manager, knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed is key. Plans definitively will change, even with careful upfront planning. For example, maybe the goals of your company change, or maybe a member of your team unexpectedly takes a new position at another company.
- **Strong organizational skills** - he role of a project manager requires using a lot of different processes to keep the project on track. Having strong organizational skills means having the ability to organize these processes and the core elements of a project to ensure nothing gets lost or overlooked, which trust me, can and does happen. To prevent this, you might decide to track daily tasks in a spreadsheet or send frequent status updates or reminders. 


#### Handling ambiguity

Ambiguity can be a big challenge in managing projects. Project managers often face ambiguity in goals, requirements, schedules, vision, or other areas related to the project. Your team will look to you to lead during times of ambiguity and change, and flexibility is especially important during these instances. Here are some different ways to help your team deal with ambiguity: 

**Keep calm.** In uncertain times, handling ambiguity with grace and poise will help inspire the members of your team to do the same. 

**Express empathy.** As a project manager, it is important to try to understand what your team is thinking and feeling, especially during times of ambiguity. Let your team members know that you care about the challenges they are facing and are there to support them.

**Communicate what you know clearly.** Define the aspects of the project that are confirmed and will not change. This helps your team get a better sense of what to expect, regardless of any aspects of the project that are still unknown or changing.

**Make decisions and stick to them.** Try not to second-guess your decisions in front of your team since this can lead to greater uncertainty. If you need to change course, clearly explain why you have chosen to do so to your team. 

**Trust the expertise of your team.** Increase clarity by having everyone on your team discuss what they already know or believe to be true about components of your project, such as what is involved in specific tasks or resources needed, based on their areas of expertise. Then, discuss what you still don’t know and brainstorm ways to gather more information.

### Reflection: Identify the essential skills of a project manager

***Scenario: Planning a Corporate Retreat***

>An event planning team of five is tasked with planning a corporate retreat for a business with 85 employees. This retreat involves hundreds of to-dos, a large budget, client-initiated changes, and important discussions with the client. The project manager knows there is a lot to do, and they are ready to lead the way. 

>Right from the beginning of the project, the project manager creates a spreadsheet to track what needs to get done in the project, and what teammates are working on. They also send status update emails twice per week to the stakeholders.

>The project has a $100,000 budget. There are many items to purchase and rent, including venue space, retreat materials, food, chairs, and tables. The project manager allows each one of their teammates up to $3,000 in expenses, with anything over requiring an approval. 

>Shortly after the project begins, the client decides they want to slightly change the theme of the project to focus on the future instead of the past. The project manager has to work with several team members to implement the changes which include graphic design, retreat materials, and signage.

>Throughout the process of changing the theme of the retreat, the project manager works closely with the client by phone, email, chat, and video to ensure that the theme updates meet their expectations.

>There is an award-ceremony dinner at the end of the retreat. The deadline to finish scheduling the dinner is in two days. Several crucial decisions need to be made: the menu, lighting, and presentation music. To make sure the deadline is met, the project manager has a video meeting with the client to ensure the dinner choices meet their expectations.


***How did the project manager enable decision-making in the project? Write 1–3 sentences.***

**A:** For instance, by giving each teammate a $3,000 purchasing limit, the project manager enables teammates to make decisions on what to buy for the retreat. If they didn’t give the team this option, then the project manager would have to make all the final purchasing decisions themselves.

***How did the project manager communicate and escalate in the project? Write 1–3 sentences.***

**A:** When the deadline for the celebration dinner was approaching, the project manager scheduled a meeting with the client to escalate and communicate the decisions that needed to be made. If the project manager didn’t escalate these decisions, it may have gone past the deadline to order food and materials for the dinner.

***How did the project manager remain flexible in the project? Write 1–3 sentences.***

**A:** When the client requested to change the theme of the retreat, the project manager had to stay flexible. They worked with teammates to get the necessary changes in place quickly.

***How did the project manager use strong organizational skills in the project? Write 1–3 sentences.***

**A:** They also used the tracker to assign tasks to specific team members. Sending status updates twice per week was also a way the project manager stayed organized. The status updates could also be viewed as a communication skill as well.

### Leadership and team dynamics 

This is called **influencing without authority**, which refers to a project manager's ability to guide teammates to complete their assigned work without acting as their direct managers. There's a few key interpersonal skills that you can use to accomplish this and guide the project outcomes, even without the authority of being your teammates' boss. 

- **Communication** -In the context of leading a team, communication can include checking in with teammates to understand how they're progressing on a task and providing clear feedback on the quality of a teammate's work. 

- **Negotiation** - Negotiation might include working with a teammate to compromise on a new deadline when they tell you that they won't be able to complete their work on time. 

- **Conflict mediation** -  Conflict mediation is a great skill to practice and develop to ensure the project does not suffer as a result. This might involve setting up a meeting with two teammates who are struggling to agree upon the best way to handle a shared task.

- **Understanding motivations** - This means getting to know your teammates and figuring out what pushes them to do their best work. Understanding motivations might also include learning how your teammates prefer to receive feedback, and how they like to receive recognition for doing a great job. You would use that individualized information to motivate and encourage each person on your team.

---

### Reflection: Influence without authority

>In this exercise, you will read a scenario and comment about how you would react to the situation. Then, you will list and describe skills that make a project manager successful. Start by considering the following scenario: 

>A co-worker is responsible for researching and providing you with a list of potential venues for a retirement party. For the last three weeks, they have been telling you they will complete the list by “the end of the week (EOW).” When you check in with them at the beginning of each of the weeks, they tell you they didn’t get around to completing it but that it will be done by the current week. 

***How might you influence this situation without authority?***

**A:** Talk to your co-worker about the overall schedule for the retirement party, and explain to them how selecting a venue as soon as possible is critical to the success of the overall event and will determine what the date of the party will be. 

Ask your co-worker about their current workload and see if there is anything you can do to free up their schedule. You can also offer to get someone else to help them, if needed.

Midweek, consider sending your co-worker a gentle reminder about their end of week commitment and ask how it's coming along.

***Write a list of the most valuable interpersonal skills required to be a successful project manager and describe how each skill contributes to a project manager’s success. Write and describe at least four skills.***

**Interpersonal skills:** 
Enabling decision making: The ability to enable decision making on the team, or gather decisions from the appropriate leader is crucial to keep projects on task and achieve their goals. As a project manager, you will need to enable decisions frequently. 

**Communicating and escalating:** As a project manager, you’ll use your communication skills in just about everything you do. And you need to know when it is appropriate to escalate, so that critical issues are raised and addressed as soon as possible to reduce negative impact on a project.

**Remaining flexible:** As a project manager, knowing how to be flexible when changes are needed is key. Plans will change — even with careful, upfront planning. As a project manager being flexible is critical to be able to course correct and adapt when the unexpected happens. 

**Organizational Skills:** Having strong organizational skills means having the ability to organize the core elements of a project and ensure nothing gets lost or overlooked. A project manager needs to be organized so that they can manage a project and all of its moving parts.

**Negotiation:** As a project manager, you’ll have to know how to balance the needs of your teammates with the needs of the project. For example, if a teammate says they can’t complete their work on time, you may need to compromise on a deadline. 

**Conflict mediation:** Resolving tension and conflict within a team is an important skill. This may involve setting up a meeting with two teammates that are struggling to agree upon the best way to handle a shared task. 

**Understanding motivations:** Getting to know your teammates and figuring out what pushes them to their best work is an effective skill to have. Understanding motivations also involves understanding how your teammates prefer to receive feedback.

# Week 3 Exploring the phases of the project life cycle

### Exploring the phases of the project life cycle - Video


***Project Life Cycle*** 
- **Initiate the project** - This is the launchpad for the entire process of your project. In this phase, you'll define project goals and deliverables, identify the budget and resources you'll need, the people involved in your project, and any other details that can impact the successful completion of your project. You'll document all this information in one place to showcase the project's value, and hopefully get approval to move forward with it. Once the project is approved, it's time to get rolling. 

- **Make a plan** - you'll make a plan for how you will meet the goals of your project. 

- **Execute & complete tasks** - your primary tasks as the project manager are to monitor progress and keep your team motivated. You also remove any obstacles that might come up so that the tasks are executed well and on time. 

- **Close the project** - Why is it important to close? One big reason is so your team has a moment to celebrate all of their hard work. Closing the project is also a chance to evaluate how the project went. You can make note of what worked and what didn't so you can plan better for next time. Even if the project was a massive success, it's helpful to take time to reflect. Closing the project is also a great way to connect with anyone outside your team who may have had interest in the project's goal.

### Summary of the project phases

The **project life cycle** is the path for your project from start to finish. Each project phase builds toward the subsequent phase and helps to create a structure for the project. To recap, the main phases of the project life cycle are: initiating the project, making a plan, executing and completing tasks, and closing the project. 

In this reading, we will summarize each phase of the project life cycle. 

#### The project life cycle

**Initiate the project**

In this phase, ask questions to help set the foundation for the project, such as:

- Who are the stakeholders?

- What are the client’s or customer’s goals?

- What is the purpose and mission of the project?

- What are the measurable objectives for the team?

- What is the project trying to improve? 

- When does this project need to be completed? 

- What skills and resources will the project require? 

- What will the project cost? What are the benefits?

**Make a plan**

In this phase, make a plan to get your project from start to finish. 

- Create a detailed project plan. What are the major milestones? What tasks or deliverables make up each milestone?  

- Build out the schedule so you can properly manage the resources, budget, materials, and timeline. Here, you will create an itemized budget.

**Execute the project**

In this phase, put all of your hard work from the first two phases into action. 

- Monitor your project team as they complete project tasks. 

- Break down any barriers that would slow or stop the team from completing tasks. 

- Help keep the team aware of schedule and deliverable expectations.

- Address weaknesses in your process or examine places where your team may need additional training to meet the project’s goals.

- Adapt to changes in the project as they arise.

**Close the project**

- In this phase, close out the project.

- Identify that your team has completed all of the requested outcomes. 

- Release your team so they can support other projects within the company.

- Take time with your team to celebrate your successes! 

- Pass off all remaining deliverables and get stakeholder approval.

- Document the lessons you and your team learned during the project.

- Reflect on ways to improve in the future.

**Key takeaway**

Each phase of the project life cycle has its own significance and reason for existing. By following the project life cycle, you’re ensuring that you are: 

- Capturing the expectations of your customer

- Setting your project up for success with a plan

- Executing project tasks and addressing any issues that arise 

- Closing out your project to capture any lessons learned. 

As you continue through this course, we will walk through each project phase in more detail.

A **project management methodology** is a set of guiding principles and processes for owning a project through its life cycle. 

**Linear** means the previous phase or task has to be completed before the next can start.

For a project like producing a new show for a television company, on the other hand, it might be more effective to use a methodology that uses an **iterative**, more flexible approach where some of the phases in tasks will overlap or happen at the same time that other tasks are being worked on. 

---

### Overview of Waterfall and Agile - Video Notes

**Waterfall** as a methodology was created in the 70s, and refers to the sequential ordering of phases. Waterfall has a linear approach.

***When would you want to use a Waterfall approach to project management?*** 

**A:** Well, when the phases of the project are clearly defined or when there are tasks to complete before another can begin, or when changes to the project are very expensive to implement once it's started.

The Waterfall method has some risk management practices to help avoid and deal with project changes.

The term **agile** means being able to move quickly and easily. It also refers to flexibility, which means being willing and able to change and adapt. Projects that use an Agile approach often have many tasks being worked on at the same time, or in various stages of completion which makes it an iterative approach.

Agile project phases overlap and tasks are completed in iterations, which in Scrum, are called sprints.

***Example of Agile*** 
Projects that are best suited for an Agile approach are those where the client has an idea of what they want but doesn't have a concrete picture in mind, or they have a set of qualities they'd like to see in the end result, but aren't as concerned with exactly what it looks like.

### Introduction to Lean and Six Sigma - video notes

**Lean Six Sigma** - It's a combination of two parent methodologies, Lean and Six Sigma. The uses for Lean Six Sigma are common in projects that have goals to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. It also focuses on team collaboration which promotes a positive work environment.

There are 5 phases in the Lean Six Sigma approach

- define 
- measure 
- analyze 
- improve
- control

commonly known as **DMAIC**. 

**DMAIC** is a strategy for process improvement, meaning you're trying to figure out where the problems are in the current process and fix them so that everything runs more smoothly. 

Remember DMAIC like this, 
- **defining** tells you what to measure 
- **measuring** tells you what to analyze 
- **analyzing** tells you what to improve 
- **improving** tells you what to control

Lean Six Sigma and the DMAIC approach are ideal when the project goal includes improving the current process to fix complex or high risk problems like improving sales, conversions, or eliminating a bottleneck, which is when things get backed up during a process.

---

### Common project management approaches and how to select one

**Popular project management approaches**

Below is a brief recap of some of the project management approaches you’ve been introduced to so far:

**Waterfall** is a traditional methodology in which tasks and phases are completed in a linear, sequential manner, and each stage of the project must be completed before the next begins. The project manager is responsible for prioritizing and assigning tasks to team members. In Waterfall, the criteria used to measure quality is clearly defined at the beginning of the project.

**Agile** involves short phases of collaborative, iterative work with frequent testing and regularly-implemented improvements. Some phases and tasks happen at the same time as others. In Agile projects, teams share responsibility for managing their own work. Scrum and Kanban are examples of Agile frameworks, which are specific development approaches based on the Agile philosophy.

**Scrum** is an Agile framework that focuses on developing, delivering, and sustaining complex projects and products through collaboration, accountability, and an iterative process. Work is completed by small, cross-functional teams led by a Scrum Master and is divided into short Sprints with a set list of deliverables.

**Kanban** is both an Agile approach and a tool that provides visual feedback about the status of the work in progress through the use of Kanban boards or charts. With Kanban, project managers use sticky notes or note cards on a physical or digital Kanban board to represent the team’s tasks with categories like “To do,” “In progress,” and “Done.”

**Lean** uses the 5S quality tool to eliminate eight areas of waste, save money, improve quality, and streamline processes. Lean’s principles state that you can do more with less by addressing dysfunctions that create waste. Lean implements a Kanban scheduling system to manage production.

**Six Sigma** involves reducing variations by ensuring that quality processes are followed every time. The Six Sigma method follows a process-improvement approach called DMAIC, which stands for define, measure, analyze, improve, and control.

**Lean Six Sigma** is a combination of Lean and Six Sigma approaches. It is often used in projects that aim to save money, improve quality, and move through processes quickly. Lean Six Sigma is also ideal for solving complex or high-risk problems. The 5S quality tool, the DMAIC process, and the use of Kanban boards are all components of this approach. 

Despite their differences, all of these project management methodologies require communication and collaboration among various teams and aim to deliver projects on time and within budget.

### video notes

**Organizational structure** refers to the way a company or organization is arranged or structured. This structure also tells you how job tasks are divided and coordinated and how all the different members of the organization relate to one another. In other words, organizational structure gives you a sense of who reports to who. 

organizational hierarchies that you may encounter at work. An organization's structure is most commonly mapped out using a **reporting chart or "org chart,"** which is short for "organizational chart." Reporting charts show the relationship between people and groups within the organization, and details who each person or group reports to.

The **Classic grouping** includes what are usually called "functional" or "top-down" structures. 

**Matrix structure** has direct higher-ups to report to and stakeholders from other departments or programs. 

Matrix structures involve team members reporting to functional and project managers simultaneously. In a Classic organization, project managers are part of a top-down hierarchy. Frequent reporting of project status updates may be required to pass up through management levels to keep higher leaders informed.

#### Interview Tip!!!

During an interview, ***you can ask about the type of organizational structure the company uses and where your role will fit in***. This will help you and the interviewer communicate clearly about the people you will engage with daily, and the expectations for the role.

### How organizational structure impacts project management - video notes

One way organizational structure can impact the way you manage a project is by the amount of **authority** given to the project manager. 

Another way organizational structures can impact project management is through **resource availability**. Managing a project is a lot easier when you know how to access the people, equipment, and budget that you need. 

The main difference with a **Matrix structure** is that employees often have two or more managers or leaders they'll need to work with and update. Your team members will have their functional manager and you, the project manager. If members are working on multiple projects, they may have even more managers.

 ### Introduction to organizational culture video notes

** Organizational culture** is in part the values employees share, as well as the organization's values, mission, history, and so on. In other words, organizational culture can be thought of as the company's personality. Understanding an organization's culture will help you navigate your team more effectively toward achieving the project's goal. It also impacts the way you plan your project.

#### Interview Tip 2!!!

 If you are interviewing for a project management position, asking about the culture is a great way to get more information about the company. It also shows the interviewer that you're knowledgeable about the impact culture can have on a project. 

 To help you gain a better sense of an organization's culture, consider the following questions. 
 
 - ***How do people prefer to communicate?*** Is it primarily through scheduled meetings, via email, over the phone? 
 - ***How are decisions made?***
majority vote or top down approvals? 
- ***What kinds of rituals are in place when someone new comes to the office?*** Are they taken out to lunch, given a tour of the building or introduced to the staff? 
- ***How are projects typically run?*** Do they prefer a Classic, do they prefer Matrix, or some other style of project management? And finally,
- ***what kinds of practices, behaviors, and values are reflected by the people in the organization?*** Is overtime or weekend work an expectation? Are there company sanctioned social events? Finding out what the company values, will tell you a lot about the culture.

Finding out what the company values, will tell you a lot about the culture. And how to handle **communication, manage expectations, and identify potential conflicts** as you work through your project. 

#### Navigating Culture

- **make sure to ask questions**. 
As you observe the culture, try asking your peers what they think is going well and what they would change. Your peers may have the same opinion as you, and if not you may learn something new you didn't learn in the interview process. Either way, you'll be in a better place to assess risk, adjust your current project, or be more prepared for projects in the future. 
- **It's also a good idea to make observations.** It's important to understand how things work, and what people like and respect about the company's culture. When working in different geographies, it's also important to be aware of established customs, like bowing, shaking hands, or wearing head coverings. This will help you gain understanding and form respectful relationships. Lastly, 
- **it's important to understand your impact.** 

A **change agent** is someone who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development. You and your project will most likely affect the organization in some way.

### Learning about an organization’s culture

It is important to learn about the culture of the organization where you work or want to work. Understanding the company’s culture can help you navigate your team through a project. Consider this quote from Peter Drucker, an expert on management: ”Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” Drucker is implying that the culture of a company always influences its success, regardless of how effective the company’s business model may be. Organizational culture is critical to the health of a company, the people who work there, and the customers it serves.

##### The importance of organizational culture 

**Identity:** An organization’s culture defines its identity. Its identity essentially describes the way the company conducts  business, both internally and externally. A company’s values and organizational culture go hand-in-hand; its values are part of its identity. You can almost think of an organization’s culture as its personality. That is why it is important to learn your company’s (or target company’s) mission and value statements. The mission and value statements will help you understand why the company exists and will give you insight into what the company believes in and how it will behave. 

**People:** Strong, positive organizational culture helps retain a company’s best employees. People who feel valued, engaged, and challenged are more likely to give their best and want to drive for success. An organization’s culture can help keep talented employees at a company, and it can attract great people too! On the other hand, a toxic culture can have the opposite effect. It is important to find an organization with a culture that fits your personality. One way to find out more about an organization's culture is to talk to the people who work there. You can also take note of the current employees’ attire, expressions, and overall behavior.

**Processes:** Organizational culture can have direct impacts on a company's processes, and ultimately, its productivity. The organization’s culture is instilled throughout the company—from its employees to how its employees do their job. For example, a company that values feedback and employee involvement might have that reflected in their processes by including many opportunities for employees to comment. By allowing employees to feel their voices are heard, this company is adhering to its culture. 

##### Understanding an organization’s culture

As a project manager, it is important to understand your company’s culture, especially because it could affect the projects you work on. Some aspects of an organization’s culture that are directly related to how you will manage projects are communication, decision-making, rituals, previous management styles, and values. To learn more about a company’s culture and how it applies to you as a project manager, you can: 

##### Ask questions

You can learn about an organization's culture by asking questions of management and peers. It can be helpful to ask these questions in the interview phase to better understand the company’s culture before accepting a position. You might want to ask questions about:

##### Atmosphere

- What is the company’s dress code? 

- How do people typically share credit at this company? 

- Is risk-taking encouraged, and what happens when people fail?

- How do managers support and motivate their team?

- How do people in this role interact with customers and users?

- When and how do team members give feedback to one another?

- What are some workplace traditions?

- What are some of the ways the company celebrates success?

##### Policies

- What are the policies around sick days and vacation?

- Does the company allow for employee flexibility (e.g., working from home, flexible working hours)?

- What policies are in place that support employees sharing their identity in the workplace?

##### Processes
- What is the company’s onboarding process?

- How do employees measure the impact of their work?

##### Values
- What are the company’s mission and value statements?

- How might the person in this role contribute to the organization’s mission?

- How does the organization support professional development and career growth?

##### Listen to people’s stories
- Listening to what current employees have to say and how they portray the company will give you great insight.

- What were employees' experiences with similar projects in the past? 

- What can they tell you about key stakeholders and customers? 

##### Take note of company rituals

Rituals can be powerful drivers of culture. They engage people and help instill a sense of shared purpose and experience. 

- How are birthdays and holidays celebrated? 

- Do employees generally eat lunch at the same time and in the same place? 

- Watch employee interactions: Observing how employees interact can help you tailor your interaction style to the company norm. 

- Are employee interactions more formal or informal in nature? 

- Are ideas solicited from employees in different roles? 

##### Understand your impact

As a project manager, you become a change agent. Remember: a change agent is a person from inside an organization who helps the organization transform by focusing on improving organizational effectiveness and development. When you begin a new role, sit down with management to better understand what is expected of you and how you can make the most of the opportunity.

##### Sharpen your communication skills

Interpersonal communication skills are a major part of project management. How a company communicates is directly tied to its organizational culture. You will most likely have interactions with various departments and management levels while executing projects. To communicate effectively, you will need to understand how to navigate the different channels in your company. Ask questions about communication practices when you start a new role such as: Is it customary to sign emails from the team rather than from you individually? Should presentations include team members or be solely presented by the project manager? This can help you make sure you are adhering to expectations.

Approaching projects differently from how similar projects were managed in the past may be met with some resistance. Although some projects may call for you to break the status quo, when you show an appreciation of your organization’s culture, you may help your team members accept any improvements you are implementing.

### Introduction to change management video notes


What is **change management**?

Change management is the process of delivering a completed project and getting people to adopt it. When project managers understand change management, and their role in the process, it helps to ensure a smooth roll out and easier adoption.

##### Core concepts 

- **creating a sense of ownership and urgency** around the project. Ownership means getting others to feel they are empowered to take responsibility for the successful completion of their tasks. Urgency means getting them to understand that the project is important and to identify what actions need to be taken to move the project along. When team members feel a sense of ownership and urgency around a project, it increases interest, motivation, and engagement with the project outcome. 

- **figure out the right combination of skills** and personalities when selecting the people who will work on your team. Find people whose knowledge and skills complement one another. If your team is selected for you, see if you're able to choose who gets assigned which tasks. If that's not possible, then it's extra important for you to find ways to connect with your team. This will get them excited about the project so then they can be advocates for change when it's needed. 

- **Effective communication** One effective way of motivating your team is to communicate clearly your vision and approach for the project. Then you can share how you see everyone working together as a team to make it happen. Communicating this idea clearly allows others to share in your vision and take ownership in bringing it to life. The final core concept is the ever important one, effective communication. And I can't stress this enough: communication is key. Having effective communication with your team means being transparent and up front with your plans and ideas and making information available. Make sure your team, along with the rest of the organization, is kept up-to-date on your progress.

### Corporate and project governance

**Governance** in business is the management framework within which decisions are made and accountability and responsibility are determined. In simple terms, governance is understanding who is in charge. In this reading, we will discuss corporate governance and project governance. It is important to learn how corporate and project governance are related since you may have to speak about governance in an interview. Additionally, you will need to understand how your project relates to the governance structure of the organization.

##### Corporate governance

Each organization is governed by its own set of standards and practices that direct and control its actions. Those standards and practices are called corporate governance, and they will influence your projects. Corporate governance is the framework by which an organization achieves its goals and objectives. Corporate governance is also a way to balance the requirements of the various corporate entities, such as stakeholders, management, and customers. Corporate governance affects every part of an organization, including action plans, internal and external controls, and performance measurements.

Governance and change management go hand-in-hand. Think back to the previous videos on change management. To successfully implement change management, it is essential that you understand the structure and culture of the organization. Effective governance in change management provides clearly defined roles and responsibilities during change. This enables the people within the organization to have a precise understanding of who makes decisions and of the relationship between those managing and participating in the change management process. 

Another example of governance within an organization is the creation and use of steering committees. Steering committees decide on the priorities of an organization and manage the general course of its operations. The steering committee essentially acts as an advisory board or council to help the project manager and the company make and approve strategic decisions that affect both the company and the project. 

##### Project governance

As a project manager, you will be responsible for project governance. Project governance is the framework for how project decisions are made. Project governance helps keep projects running smoothly, on time, and within budget. Project governance involves all the key elements that make a project successful. It tells you what activities an organization does and who is responsible for those activities. Project governance covers policies, regulations, functions, processes, procedures, and responsibilities. 

##### How project and corporate governance intersect
Project governance needs to be tailored to your organization's specific needs. These needs will influence how you implement and monitor the governance framework on your project. Project governance concerns those areas of corporate governance that are specifically related to project activities. Effective project governance ensures that an organization’s projects are aligned to the organization’s larger objectives, are delivered efficiently, and are sustainable. This includes:

- Considering the long- and short-term interests of your organization

- Making thoughtful decisions about which projects to take on and avoiding projects if you do not have sufficient resources

- Providing timely, relevant, and reliable information to the board of directors and other major stakeholders 

- Eliciting the input and buy-in of senior managers since they are the decision-makers 

- During the initiation phase, prioritizing clear, reachable, and sustainable goals in order to reduce confusion and conflict

- During the planning phase, assigning ownership and accountability to an experienced team to deliver, monitor, and control the process 

- During the execution phase, learning from mistakes and adapting to new or improved knowledge

Corporate governance can involve clearing many hurdles before making decisions. These decisions can influence not only a single project, but the entire corporation. 

At the same time, corporate governance can help support project governance, as it provides oversight on compliance and mitigating risk and offers guidance and direction for project managers. Good corporate governance can also help project managers secure resources, get issues addressed, avoid delays in decision-making, get buy-in from stakeholders, and achieve visibility for projects on the executive level.
